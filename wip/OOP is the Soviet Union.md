# OOP is the Soviet Union

In this article, I will prove to you that Object-Oriented Programming, as commonly practiced, works a lot like the Soviet Union. You may consider this absurd, highly unlikely, and contrary to your experience, but bear with me, as this should be interesting to you.

The Soviet Union has become known as the textbook example of corruption, bad planning, cognitive dissonance, and just plain evil. But few people understand what led to that situation, what dragged it on for so long, and how to stop that from happening again.

## Concepts of OOP

inversion of control, aka indirection, leads to bureaucracy

Too much encapsulation means that information has to be passed around between different units, which takes extra time and effort, and leads to a slow system overall.

Command and control happens when the upper levels of the system dictate the control flow, and the format of data and interfaces.

Only the owners of code can change it, and that means problems that would best be solved by changing many different sections of code, don't get solved, or are solved poorly, by changing only the files that you own.

Knowledge is very segmented, and no one really understands the whole system.

Information hiding is censorship.


What keeps people from fixing this obvious problem? Existing power structures, which are deeply embedded in the class hierarchy and the interfaces. But they are brittle, so the only way to change them is to rewrite them, like a revolution. But people are scared of breaking things and doing big changes, so they remain in the abusive relationship.


Council communism is when the owners of a certain part of code decide that they wanna do things a certain way, and 

If I didn't convince you, then damn, maybe I should've done a better job. Or maybe you've become the subject of Soviet propaganda. As we've seen, it's nearly impossible to tell when you've been lied to your whole life.
